## Dev Mode

Dev Mode shows your developer's stress level in the manor of the color codes once used by the Department of Homeland Security to show the nation's terror alert level.

<div align="center">
        <img width="45%" src="/../master/public/screenshot.png?raw=true" alt="Dev Mode Screenshot" title="Dev Mode Screenshot"</img>
        <img height="0" width="8px">
        <img width="45%" src="/../master/public/homeland_security.png?raw=true" alt="Homeland Security Advisory System" title="Homeland Security Advisory System"></img>
</div>

## Why

The purpose of this project is to play with Event Broadcasting in Laravel 5.1. My coworkers have joked that they need a way to tell what my stress level is to tell if they should bother me with something, so I decided to build it and attempt to have real-time feedback and alerts.
